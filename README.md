# WTT Armory Stripper
Allows to remove specific weapons from [WTT - Armory mod](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/2952-wtt-armory) for SPT.

Requires actual mod preliminarily installed, duh.

## Usage
- Install [WTT - Armory](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/2952-wtt-armory/).
- Download [latest release](https://github.com/Mugnum/SPT_WTTArmoryStripper/releases).
- Backup "user\mods\WTT-Armory\db\" folder just in case.
- Extract to root SPT folder (next to EscapeFromTarkov.exe) and run.
- Manually delete files in "user\mods\WTT-Armory\db\CustomBotLoadouts\", I didn't bother cleaning up boss loadouts.
- For other weapons, recompile the program using Visual Studio.
- Please don't bother the actual WTT team in their comments it breaks something.
